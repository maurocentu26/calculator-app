### What I learned

I learned how to structure JavaScript code better. Above all to know when to modularize my program, to divide it into functions to make it more readable.

### Continued development

As I continue to learn JavaScript I would like to redo this, and other, projects using a framework or library like React or Angular. I consider it necessary to see the facilities that they offer us when developing this type of applications.
